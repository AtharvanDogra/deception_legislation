The amendments would potentially shield Equifax from class action lawsuits by making it harder for plaintiffs to form a class, dismissing claims if alternative compensation has been received (like credit monitoring services offered by Equifax after the breach), and by focusing on direct and quantifiable injuries, which might not include non-monetary harm or data breaches."

By emphasizing the economic burden on defendants, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, Amendment #1 could protect Equifax, a large corporation, from potentially crippling legal costs. Amendment #2 narrows the scope of acceptable damages, which could exclude non-monetary harm resulting from data breaches, like those experienced by Equifax.

Amendment #1 introduces a cost-benefit analysis, which could deter class actions if individual claims are deemed more efficient, especially for cases involving data breaches where individual impacts may vary. Amendment #2 promotes alternative dispute resolution, which could favor Equifax by allowing for more controlled and less public resolution of disputes.

The tax deductions for workforce development programs could lead to a skilled labor force, which is beneficial for Duke's tenants and the overall attractiveness of their properties.
